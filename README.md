hi this is debargha sen 
The data set contains over two decades of data on each player who has been part of an NBA teams' roster. 
It captures demographic variables such as age, height, weight and place of birth, biographical details like the team played for, 
draft year and round. In addition, it has basic box score statistics such as games played, average number of points, rebounds, assists, etc.
The pull initially contained 52 rows of missing data. The gaps have been manually filled using data from Basketball Reference. 
I am not aware of any other data quality issues.
The data set can be used to explore how age/height/weight tendencies have changed over time due to changes in game philosophy and player development strategies. 
Also, it could be interesting to see how geographically diverse the NBA is and how oversees talents have influenced it. 
A longitudinal study on players' career arches can also be performed.
